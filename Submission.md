- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
    40 hours. the process of understanding the code took a good portion of the time.

- Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors?
    No

- Did you use any external resources?
    No. Just a reference on how to convert Infix notation to Postfix notation.

- (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the assignment? How would you improve this 
    I think the most interesting part of the assignment was the function calculateFun. I consulted a lot of sources during the debugging
    process and finally chose to use the concept of converting infix notation (standard arithmetic notation) to a postfix notation and then
    evaluates the postfix notation. The advantage of the postfix notation is that there is no ambiguity in the order of operations, and I
    found the process to be somewhat difficult but very interesting.

    Areas for improvement: My code looks as if it could be more optimized, for example some parts could be abstracted into separate 
    functions or simplified.
